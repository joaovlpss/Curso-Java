# Java Course
Repo to store scripts from my Udemy complete Java course. I intend to update it until I finish the course.
Each folder has been structured by course section. "sections_1_8" contains all code from sections 1 through 8, "sections_8_16" contains all code from sections 8 through 16, and so on. 

    /applications: Folder for the scripts that use classes from /entities. Mostly main functions and adjancents. 

    /entities: Folder for class definitions and declarations.
        /utils : Folder for utilitaries.
        /enums : Folder for enumerations.

    /notes: Folder for personal notetaking for the course. Notes are in PT-BR.
