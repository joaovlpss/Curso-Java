# Java Course
Repo to store scripts from my Udemy complete Java course. I intend to update it until I finish the course. Info about each folder below:

    /applications Folder for the scripts that use classes from /entities. Mostly main funcitions.

    /entities Folder for class definitions and declarations.

    /exercises Folder for loose exercises or smaller programs.
