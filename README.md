# Java Course
Repo to store scripts from my Udemy complete Java course. I intend to update it until I finish the course. Info about each folder below:

    /applications: Folder for the scripts that use classes from /entities. Mostly main functions and adjancents. 

    /entities: Folder for class definitions and declarations.

    /exercises: Folder for loose exercises or smaller programs.

    /notes: Folder for personal notetaking for the course. Notes are in PT-BR.
